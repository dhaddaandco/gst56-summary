While providing relief for the farmers, it is important that the domestic manufacturing does not get adversely impacted. If agriculture machinery is fully exempted, the manufacturers/dealers of these goods would not be able to claim input tax credit on the GST paid on raw materials and will have to reverse the ITC paid on the inputs. This would increase their effective tax incidence and cost of production. This may in turn be passed on to farmers in the form of higher prices which in turn would make the measure counterproductive.</td>

      <td>Why has small agricultural tractors not been fully exempted from GST?\nThe objective is to provide relief to the farmers while not disincentivising domestic producers. Fully exempting small tractors would be counterproductive. When the rate of tax on any goods is nil, the suppliers cannot claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) on the inputs used in manufacture of the goods and will have to reverse the same. This means that the producers have to absorb this cost which will eventually be passed to the buyers.</td>

The reason for taxing cotton in GST is to avoid breakage in input credit chain and the GST paid on cotton is available as input tax credit for the textile industry. This will ultimately benefit the consumers.</td>

This is in line with the fibre neutral policy. However, the listed items are multi use goods.\nReducing GST on these goods will require an end use-based mechanism which is against the current policy of moving away from end use-based exemptions.</td>

While inversion may deepen, under GST, refund of accumulated credit on account of inverted duty is available. Therefore, accumulated input tax credit gets neutralised by way of refund. The process reform will ensure expedited sanction of the refunds.</td>

This would increase their effective tax incidence and cost of production. This may in turn be passed on to consumers/ patients in the form of higher prices which in turn would make the measure counterproductive.</td>

This measure does not create any new inverted duty structure as the existing structure already had inverted duty structure although this measure may deepen the inversion. However, under GST, refund of accumulated input tax credit arising on account of inverted duty structure is available to manufacturers. GST Council has also recommended process reforms to enable expedited refunds.</td>
